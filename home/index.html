                    <p>Oh, that one. I got it in college</p>
                    <p>undergrad?</p>
                    <p>Yes, Vancouver. i don’t remember the street--it was probably Oak. It was the Artizia near UBC.
                        That was the style at the time--a cute tank and a cardigan. I was always wearing cardigans.
                        Some of them came in twin sets--I don’t think that one did</p>
                    <p>so what did kookai mean to you?</p>
                    <p>Kookai was, like, fancy. Aritzia was kind of like the runway. Instead of looking at fashion shows
                        to see what’s trendy, people looked at what was sold at Aritzia. It was cool and trendy.
                        It was like the local style guide. It was kind of for young professionals.</p>
                    <p>was it expensive? kind of like a treat?</p>
                    <p>Yes. It’s not cheap. I guess it's like the price of Aritzia now.</p>
                    <p>Kerrisdale. It was like the Hamptons but cuter, and people liked to walk around there.</p>
                    <p>I think I have a picture of me and Uncle Alan and two of our friends rollerblading. I feel like
                        he sent it to me. I’ll try and find it.</p>
                    <p>okay. i think that's all i need.</p>
                    <p>Okay, call me if you have more questions</p>
